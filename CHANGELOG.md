# Changelog

All notable changes to opennosh will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.0.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- Create the complete nutrition and strength schema on a clean PostgreSQL 16 database, with a tested development rollback to the empty Alembic base revision.
- Keep USDA reference foods, CC0 community foods, Open Food Facts data, and private custom foods in distinct stores with their required provenance, licensing, and attribution fields.
- Protect every user-owned record with a required indexed owner reference, including database-enforced same-owner recipe ingredients and workout sets.
- Model recipes, food logs, body metrics, exercises, workouts, workout sets, and nutrition targets with validated units and value constraints.

### Changed

- Apply pending database migrations before the API starts and verify the full migration boot path in continuous integration.
- Provide native development commands for upgrading or downgrading the database schema.

## [0.1.0.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- Run a working local FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and responsive Next.js application stack with one Docker Compose command.
- Use the database-aware health endpoint to distinguish a healthy service from a safe degraded response, with bounded probes, operator logging, and a documented OpenAPI contract.
- Configure development database credentials while Docker images, Compose dependencies, and service health checks handle local orchestration.
- Develop reproducibly from locked Python and TypeScript dependencies, with commands and tests covering API success, failure, timeout, lifecycle, settings, and web rendering paths.
- Trust every pull request to run API linting, strict typing, unit and PostgreSQL integration tests, web linting, typing, tests, production builds, Compose validation, documentation, and whitespace checks.

## [0.0.1.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- Added the MIT repository license, CC0 food-pack dedication and legal code, contributor credits, and a repository-wide licensing map.
- Added repository-wide validation that rejects retired project-name variants in user-facing documentation and metadata.

### Changed

- Renamed the product, package, command, and documentation identity to exact lowercase `opennosh`.
- Finalized v1 as multi-user nutrition plus strength tracking with opt-in Open Food Facts barcode lookup and an attributed wger exercise catalogue.
- Set a hard two-month initial build window and documented tenant isolation, attribution safety, and source-license boundaries.

## [0.0.0.1] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- Added repository governance, automated document validation, and the branch-to-pull-request development workflow.
- Clarified unresolved license recommendations, the canonical food-pack specification path, and the current health-support resource policy.
